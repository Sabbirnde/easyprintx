## ðŸ”’ Security Issue Fixed: Shop Owner Contact Information Exposure

### **Problem Identified**
The `shop_info` table was publicly readable, exposing shop owners' **personal email addresses and phone numbers** to anyone without authentication. This created serious privacy and security risks including:

- **Personal data exposure** - Private contact details accessible to all users
- **Spam/harassment potential** - Email addresses exposed for malicious use  
- **Identity theft risk** - Personal information available without consent
- **Privacy violations** - No consent for public data sharing

### **Solution Implemented**

âœ… **Created separate data layers:**

**1. Public Shop Directory (`public_shop_directory` table)**
- **Publicly accessible** - Contains only business information
- **Safe data only**: Shop name, description, address, business hours, services
- **No personal contact info** - Protects owner privacy
- **RLS Policy**: `Public can view active shop listings`

**2. Private Shop Info (`shop_info` table)** 
- **Owner-only access** - Contains sensitive contact details
- **Private data**: Email addresses, phone numbers, private notes
- **Secured with RLS** - Only shop owners can access their own data
- **RLS Policy**: `Shop owners can manage their private info`

### **Database Changes Made**

```sql
-- âœ… Created secure public shop directory
CREATE TABLE public.public_shop_directory (
  -- Business info only - no personal contact details
  shop_name, description, address, business_hours, 
  services_offered, rating, logo_url, website_url
);

-- âœ… Secured existing shop_info table  
DROP POLICY "Public can view shop info" ON shop_info;
CREATE POLICY "Shop owners can manage their private info" ON shop_info;
```

### **Application Updates**

**Customer-facing pages now use public directory:**
- âœ… `FindShops.tsx` - Uses `public_shop_directory` 
- âœ… `BookSlot.tsx` - Uses `public_shop_directory`
- âœ… Contact info shows "Contact via booking" instead of exposing private details

**Shop owner pages use private info when appropriate:**
- âœ… `ShopProfile.tsx` - Merges public + private data for owners
- âœ… Private contact details only accessible to shop owners
- âœ… Public business info synchronized between both tables

### **Security Benefits**

ðŸ”’ **Privacy Protection** - Personal contact information is now private  
ðŸ”’ **Data Minimization** - Customers only see necessary business information  
ðŸ”’ **Access Control** - Proper RLS policies enforce owner-only access  
ðŸ”’ **Future-proof** - Clear separation between public and private data  

### **No Functionality Loss**

âœ… All existing features continue to work  
âœ… Shop discovery remains fully functional  
âœ… Booking system works seamlessly  
âœ… Shop owners can still manage all their information  
âœ… Customer experience is unchanged  

The fix follows **security best practices** of data minimization and least privilege access while maintaining all application functionality.
